# AuthenticationProvider

The `AuthenticationProvider` in Spring Security is part of the authentication mechanism that is invoked automatically as part of the security filter chain. Here’s how it works and where it fits into the process:

* **`AuthenticationProvider` in the Background**:
  * The `authenticationProvider` bean is a component that is automatically used by Spring Security's `AuthenticationManager` to handle the authentication process.
  * When the `SecurityFilterChain` is set up, Spring Security automatically configures an `AuthenticationManager` to use the `authenticationProvider` bean you defined.
  * This means that while you don’t directly call `authenticationProvider` in your `securityFilterChain`, it’s integrated into the security configuration.
* **How It Fits Together**:
  * When a user tries to authenticate (e.g., by providing credentials in Postman), the `SecurityFilterChain` intercepts the request.
  * The request is processed by Spring Security’s filters, which use the `AuthenticationManager` to handle authentication.
  * The `AuthenticationManager`, in turn, uses the `authenticationProvider` bean to validate the user’s credentials.
  * The `authenticationProvider` bean provides the logic for checking the credentials against the database and returning an authentication result.

* **`DaoAuthenticationProvider`**:
  * **What it is**: A class provided by Spring Security that uses a **`UserDetailsService`** to retrieve user details and authenticate them.
  * **What it does**: It checks user credentials (like username and password) against what’s stored in a database or another source.
* **Setting Password Encoder**:
  * **`provider.setPasswordEncoder(NoOpPasswordEncoder.getInstance())`**:
    * **What it is**: Sets a **password encoder** for the `DaoAuthenticationProvider`.
    * **What it does**: The `NoOpPasswordEncoder` is a **dummy encoder** that does nothing. It doesn’t actually encode passwords, which means passwords are checked in their original form.
    * **Why it's used**: For testing purposes only. In a real application, you should use a proper password encoder (like `BCryptPasswordEncoder`) to hash passwords securely.
* **Setting UserDetailsService**:
  * **`provider.setUserDetailsService(userDetailsService)`**:
    * **What it is**: Sets a **`UserDetailsService`** for the `DaoAuthenticationProvider`.
    * **What it does**: The `UserDetailsService` is an interface that loads user-specific data (like username and password) from a data source (like a database). The `DaoAuthenticationProvider` will use this service to get the user details and authenticate the user.
    * **How it works**: When a user tries to log in, the `DaoAuthenticationProvider` will use the `UserDetailsService` to fetch the user details from the database and compare the provided password with the one stored.
