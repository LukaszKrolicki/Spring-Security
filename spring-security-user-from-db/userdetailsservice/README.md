**Implementing `loadUserByUsername`**:

* **`loadUserByUsername(String username)`**: This method is defined by the `UserDetailsService` interface and is used to load user-specific data. Itâ€™s called by Spring Security during the authentication process.

**Fetching User Data**:

* **`userRepo.findByUsername(username)`**: Uses the repository to find a user by their username from the database.
* **Handling `null`**: If the user is not found in the database, it prints a message and throws a `UsernameNotFoundException`. This exception is handled by Spring Security to indicate that authentication has failed because the user does not exist.

**Returning UserDetails**:

* **`new UserPrincipal(user)`**: Creates and returns an instance of `UserPrincipal`, which implements `UserDetails`. This object contains user-specific information required by Spring Security, such as username, password, and authorities (roles or permissions).
